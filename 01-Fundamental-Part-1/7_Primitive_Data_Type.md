The 7 Primitive data types in JavaScript
1. Number: Floating point numbers > used for decimal and Integers 
   ex: let age = 23;

2. String: Sequence of characters > used for text
   ex: let firstName = 'Jonas';

3. Boolean: Logical type that can be true or false > used for taking decisions
   ex: let fullAge = true;

4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is yet defined('empty value')
   ex: let children;

5. Null: Also means 'empty value'

6. Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed[Not useful for now]

7. BigInt (ES2020): Larger integers that the Number type can hold.

*JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.
